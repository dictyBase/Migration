# Basic guide for contribution

All contributions are made via pull request. Note that **all patches from all
contributors should get reviewed**. After a pull request is made other contributors
will offer feedback, and if the patch passes review a maintainer will accept it
with a comment. When pull requests fail testing, authors are expected to update
their pull requests to address the failures until the tests pass and the pull
request merges successfully.

At least one review from a maintainer is required for all patches (even patches
from other maintainers). If only one maintainer is listed in the MAINTAINERS
file, then review is not required for patches from the sole maintainer (however
it is encouraged).
