#Importing data from analysis 
This kind of data could be generated by running analysis software on existing
data particularly on biological sequence. EST alignments, ortholog, protein
domain etc. are examples of this kind of data.
These analysis data generally exports in standard biological exchangable
formats(such as GFF3) for which there is already a parser and/or loader is
already available. The idea here is to generate those standard output and
import in postgresql.

## EST alignments
##Interpro domains
## Orthologs
## Promoter information
