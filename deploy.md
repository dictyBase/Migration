# Deployment
Dictybase deployment strategy is inspired by [twelve factor
app](https://12factor.net/) methodology. Our strategy primarily follows these concepts..
* Declarative format for automation, such as [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).
* Maximum portability across OS, for example both `docker` and `kubernetes`
  could run in all major OS.
* Suitable for deployment on cloud platforms. 
* Minimum divergence between development and production platforms.
* Scaling of applications.


## Strategy
For deploying, all dictyBase softwares are packaged using
[docker](https://docker.io). The packaged(containerized) application are
generally available publicly from [dictybase
repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/dictybase/) of docker hub. Each repository
in the docker hub will be linked to its respective source code in
[github](https://github.com). The github source code and docker hub repository
are linked and the application packages are automatically built from the source
code. The package applications(containerized applcations) are then deployed to
[kubernetes](https://k8s.io) cluster(manages lifecycle of containerized
applications). For development platform of kubernetes, we use
[minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/#minikube) and for production
we use [google container engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/).

## Development platform
It is strongly recommended to use a particular version of tool if it mentioned
specifically in the document, otherwise use the latest release.

### Requirements
#### Minikube
Minikube runs a single node kubernetes cluster inside a `VM` for testing out
local deployment.
> **Minikube version: v0.25.0**   
> **Kubernetes version: v1.9.0**

* [Install](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube#installation) minikube.
  Download the specified version and use the `start` command with decent bit of
  memory(at least 4-5GB), cpu(at least 4) and disk space(at least 25-30GB).   

![](images/userinput.png)
>`$_> minikube start --cpus=4 --memory=4096 --disk-size=30g --kubernetes-version=v1.9.0`   

 The above command line is assumed to be for default `Virtualbox` driver. To
 use any other drivers, consult the
 [documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube#requirements). The
 default `Virtualbox` driver is easy to use and works better across versions.
 The other drivers might requires additional configurations but could provide
 better performance for that particular `OS`.
* Enable `heapster` addon for collecting and displaying cluster statistics.


![](images/userinput.png)
> `$_> minikube addons enable heapster`   

##### Useful minikube commands 
`minikube dashboard` - Opens up a kubernetes dashboard in the web browser.
`minikube ip` - To retrieve the IP of the cluster, useful for accessing software endpoints.   
`minikube logs` - Retrieve logs of running cluster, useful for debugging.   
`minikube service list` - List of available software endpoints in the running cluster. 

![](images/userinput.png)
> Usually run `minikube kubectl <command> --help` to read the manual

#### kubectl
Command line client for interacting with kubernetes cluster.
> **version: v1.9.0**
* [Install](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) kubectl.
  It is also preferable to enable [shell
  autocompletion](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#enabling-shell-autocompletion)(https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#enabling-shell-autocompletion)
> Note: If you are authorized to use google cloud, then use the bundled kubectl
> that comes with the [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/) command
> line tool.

* Handy kubectl commands...   
> kubectl get po and kubectl describe po   
> kubectl get svc and kubectl describe svc   
> kubectl get events   
> kubectl logs   

#### helm
Command line package manager for kubernetes cluster. It used helm chart(yaml
manifests) to deploy containerized applications in kubernetes. Though `kubectl`
can deploy manifests directly to kubernetes, we will use helm for better
management. For our purpose, `kubectl` will primarily be used for retrieving
and configuring information about cluster.
> **version: v2.8.0**
* [Install](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-the-helm-client) helm.
* Run `helm init` to setup interaction with kubernetes for the first time.
* To upgrade helm, reinstall the version and run `helm init --upgrade` only
  to upgrade helm version in kubernetes.
* Some other useful helm commands ....
> helm install   
> helm upgrade   
> helm delete   
> helm list   
> helm repo   
> helm inspect   

* **Add dictybase helm repository**

![](images/userinput.png)
>`$_> helm repo add dictybase https://dictybase-docker.github.io/kubernetes-charts`

## Deploying applications
### Concept
Application deployments are managed by grouping them into **virtual application
stack** where every stack provides a particular service(shares similar functions).
In other words, each stack can also be considered as **multi tiered applications.***
Every stack is generally consists of the following core applications 
* **Backend:** Application that provide storage, for example,
[postgresql](http://postgresql.org) database application.
* **API server/middleware/microservice:** Application that provides HTTP(and
grpc) endpoints to access data from the backend based on an specified `API`.
* **Frontend:** A [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) based application that runs
in a web browser and fetches data through `API server`.

So, overall a basic stack is organized as 
> **frontend <--> api server <---> backend**.

Now, there are other applications that might be part of some stacks. These are
generally management applications to run one-off tasks(runs to completion).
* **Schema loader:** Application that loads/manage database schema in the
  backend.
* **Data generator:** Generate or pre-process raw data to make it compatible
  for loading. Unless the data is embeddable, it should be  a S3(or compatible)
bucket. For our case we are using  [minio](https://docs.minio.io/) for
production and development.
* **Data loader:** Bootstrap the backend with initial data. Unless the data is
  embeddable, it should be made available from a S3(or compatible) bucket. For
our case we are using [minio](https://docs.minio.io/) for production and
development.The generated data is generally loaded in batch.

### Common checklist and steps for installing charts

* Make sure you have added the correct repositories. If not, add them with
  `helm repo add` command.

![](images/userinput.png)
> `$_> helm repo list`   

* Check for available dictybase charts   

![](images/userinput.png)
> `$_> helm search -l dicty`   

* Update repositories   

![](images/userinput.png)
> `$_> helm repo update`   


* Always add the `--namespace dictybase` parameters for deploying every chart,
  otherwise they might not work as expected. 

* At least aware about different configuration parameters and their default
  values(if any) of the chart you are deploying. The `README.md` of every
accompanying chart is available
[here](https://github.com/dictybase-docker/kubernetes-charts/). If no
`README.md` is available, read through the `values.yaml` file, it is generally
more or less annotated for understanding.

* In addition, use `helm inspect <chart-name>` to check for all configurable options.

* Configuration parameters could be set either from command line `--set
  something=xxxx` or through a yaml file or a combination of both.

### Backends
Make sure you did the following, or at least update the repositories


#### `PostgreSQL`
The postgreSQL backend is currently used by following api services.   
+ user-api
+ content-api

##### `Quick deploy`

![](images/userinput.png)
```shell
$_> helm install dictybase/dictycontent-postgres --namespace dictybase \
		--set postgresPassword=somepass...  \
		--set dictycontentPassword=someotherpass.. \ 
		--set dictyuserPassword=someotherpass.. \ 
```

For detail understanding of the deploy process read the sections below.

##### `Step by step`
* First create a `yaml` configuration file to setup the passwords for the admin
  and user of database.

![](images/userinput.png)
```yaml
postgresPassword: somepass...
dictycontentPassword: somepassagain...
dictyuserPassword: somepassagain...
```
Remember you could also change the default name of the databases and users
through configuration parameters.

![](images/userinput.png)
> `$_> helm install dictybase/dictycontent-postgres -f myconfig.yaml --namespace dictybase`   

It will print out bunch of commands about how to gather information about chart
from the command line. The easy way will be to use web based kubernetes
dashboard(remember `minikube dashboard` command) and look under the `dictybase` namespace.

* Wait for 14-19 seconds for the database to get ready for the first time. Have
  two sips of coffee or any other beverages. 
* Run the following to check for ip, kind of tells you that itâ€™s running at least.

![](images/userinput.png)
> `$_> minikube service --url dictycontent-backend --namespace dictybase`

Expect an output something like this...   
`http://192.168.99.100:30372`

Alternatively, check for the pod status in the kubernetes dashboard which will
look like similar to this
![dashboard-pod](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48740/35778877-2482c5d4-098a-11e8-96e7-d1c2b42b51ef.png).
There might be only one pod and they should have a green tick mark, otherwise
the deployment is probably botched.


### `Arangodb`
Arangodb backend is currently used by following api services.   
+ identity-api 

![](images/userinput.png)
> `$_> helm install dictybase/arango-operator --namespace dictybase`   

![](images/userinput.png)
> `$_> helm install dictybase/arangodb --namespace dictybase`   

### `Nats`
[Nats](https://nats.io) is the default messaging backend.

![](images/userinput.png)
> `$_> helm install dictybase/nats-operator --namespace dictybase`   

![](images/userinput.png)
> `$_> helm install dictybase/nats --namespace dictybase`   

### `Object storage(S3 compatible)`
* Make a yaml configuration file 
```yaml
mode: standalone
persistence:
	enabled: true
	# the size is configurable
	size: 6Gi 
service:
	type: NodePort
defaultBucket:
  enabled: true
  name: dictybase
  policy: none
  purge: false
# It is kind of username and password
# you can use it to login from the web interface and manage files
accessKey: ANYTHINGYOUWANT
secretKey: ITISASECRET
```

* You could read about all configuration parameters by running   

![](images/userinput.png)
> `$_> helm inspect kubernetes-charts/minio`

* or go [here](https://hub.kubeapps.com/charts/stable/minio)

* Install the chart

![](images/userinput.png)
> `$_> helm install kubernetes-charts/minio -f config.yaml --namespace dictybase`


### `Schema loader`

![](images/userinput.png)
> `$_> helm install dictybase/dictycontent-schema --namespace dictybase`

![](images/userinput.png)
> `$_> helm install dictybase/dictyuser-schema --namespace dictybase`

```yaml
database:
  name: auth
  user: dictybase
  password: itisbetweenus   
collection:
  name: identity
```
![](images/userinput.png)
> `$_> helm install dictybase/arango-database -f config.yaml --namespace dictybase`

![](images/userinput.png)
> `$_> helm install dictybase/arango-collection -f config.yaml --namespace dictybase`

#### Notes
* You might have to run the same chart if thereâ€™s a change in database or new
  database/schema being added.

### `API services`

#### `Content`
![](images/userinput.png)
> ```$_> helm install dictybase/content-api-server --namespace dictybase```   

#### `User`
![](images/userinput.png)
> ```$_> helm install dictybase/user-api-server --namespace dictybase```   

#### `Identity`
```yaml
database:
  name: auth
  user: dictybase
  password: itisbetweenus   
collection:
  name: identity
```
![](images/userinput.png)
> ```$_> helm install dictybase/identity-api-server -f config.yaml --namespace dictybase```   

#### `Auth`
* You have `openssl` and `base64` available in your command
  line. If they are installed, running them should print out
  their usage help, otherwise you will get `command not found`. If
  itâ€™s the later case, install the program **before proceeding any
  further.** Generally, they are installed by default for latest Mac
  and linux OS.

* Generate public and private keys. If you run the following
  commands, the `app.rsa` will be the private key.

![](images/userinput.png)
> `$_> openssl genrsa -out keys/app.rsa 2048`   
> `$_> openssl rsa -in keys/app.rsa -pubout -out keys/app.rsa.pub`

* Create configuration file for oauth providers as described
  [here](https://github.com/dictyBase/authserver#create-configuration-file). Go
  [here](https://github.com/dictyBase/authserver/tree/develop#supported-providers)
  to set up client secrets for all the supported providers. However, for
  developmental purposes, one or two providers should be a good start.

* **Deploy** the chart. The command assumes your private key to be `app.rsa`,
  public key is in `app.rsa.pub` and configuration file is `app.json`. Those
  name are not mandatory, if they are in differently named files, change the
  command accordingly.

![](images/userinput.png)
> `$_> helm install --namespace dictybase --set publicKey=$(base64 -w0 app.rsa.pub) \   
>                --set privateKey=$(base64 -w0 app.rsa) \   
>                --set configFile=$(base64 -w0 app.json) dictybase/authserver

#### Notes
* All services should start instantly. Run the following check for its endpoint..   

![](images/userinput.png)
> ```$_> minikube service list -n dictybase```   
> ```$_> minikube service --url <service-name> -n dictybase```   

Make sure you note down its port number to use it for the next command.

* You could verify it by checking its `/healthz` endpoint...

![](images/userinput.png)
> ```$_> curl -i $(minikube ip):<port number>/healthz```   

`The above should return a successful HTTP response.`

* Alternatively, you could for check for the `pods` log in the dashboard which
  is expected to look like this ![192 168 99 100-30000- laptop with hidpi
screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48740/35778408-739c043e-0983-11e8-8a99-12c84d17b0c1.png)

### `Data generator`
It will generate the serialized json from the existing html pages to be loaded
by the `data loader`. Depending on the size, it might be loaded to a s3 compatible storage.

### `Data loader`
It will use the [content api](https://dictybase.github.io/dictybase-api/) and
load the serialized json from a s3 compatible storage(depending on the size).

### `Frontend`
There will be multiple frontend applications using this stack, so their
deployment information will be linked from here. At this point,
[Dicty-Stock-center](https://github.com/dictyBase/Dicty-Stock-Center/) and
[Genomepage](https://github.com/dictyBase/genomepage/) are few of the potential
consumers for this stack.




It should start instantly. Run the following check for its endpoint..

Thereâ€™s extra information available in the [source code]
(https://github.com/dictyBase/authserver) and chartâ€™s
[repository](https://github.com/dictybase-docker/kubernetes-charts/tree/master/authserver)
Helm inspect command `helm inspect <chart-name>` also provides information
about various configuration options.
